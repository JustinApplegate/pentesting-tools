# Pentesting Tools Install Scripts
These two scripts are intended to automatically install all the pentesting tools needed for an engagement. While each penetration tester has their own setup, it helps to have scripts that will automatically install everything needed for them in case their drive fails or they are in a new environment. `install.sh` is intended for Linux systems, and `install.ps1` is intended for Windows systems. The tools they install are listed below:

### `install.sh`
* exiftool (Metadata Extractor)
* python3 (Programming Environment)
* John the Ripper (Password recovery)
* nikto (Vulnerability Scanner)
* nmap (Network Scanner and Local Host Enumeration)
* sqlmap (SQL Injection Scanner)
* sublist3r (Subdomain Brute Forcing)
* aircrack-ng (Wireless audit)
* Metasploit (Privilege escalation)
* impacket (Kerberos Ticket Manipulation)
* Pupy (Remote Access Tool)
* Hping (Network Traffic Manipulation)
* PEAS-suite (Privilege Escalation)


### `install.ps1`
* Burp Suite (Web proxy)
* Ghidra (Reverse Engineering)
* Wireshark (Packet Analysis)
* WHOIS (DNS Reconnaissance)
* macro_pack (Macro Payload Generator)
* PrivescCheck (Privilege Escalation)
